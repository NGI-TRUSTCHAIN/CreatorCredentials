Verifiable creator credentials can increase trust and transparency in the cultural and creative industries.

Here are some examples of how VCs could be used:

* Verifying the identity and credentials of freelancers or contractors working for a media organisation (**freelancer verification**);
* Establishing the identity and reliability of sources used in news publications, particularly when anonymity is required (**source verification**);
* Providing proof of ownership or authorship of copyrighted works, such as articles, videos, or music, including the ability to state whether the content was created by a human creator or generated by an artificial intelligence model (**copyright verification**);
* Demonstrating the creator's or rightsholder's authority to provide metadata or licence information for digital work (**metadata verification**);
* Confirming that a media organisation has the permission to use or distribute specific content, such as photographs or video footage (**content licensing**);
* Verifying that a user or entity has acquired a licence for use of digital media content from a rightsholder (**licensing receipt**);
* Supporting digital rights management (DRM) and granting access to digital media content, supplementary material, stories, or multimedia assets (**access control**).
